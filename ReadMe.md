## Summary
The code snippet is a Solidity smart contract called "FundMe" that allows users to fund the contract with Ether. It checks if the amount of Ether sent by the user meets a minimum value in USD before accepting the funds. The contract keeps track of the amount funded by each address and the list of funders. The contract also has a function to withdraw the funds, which can only be called by the contract owner.

## Example Usage
```solidity
FundMe contract = new FundMe();
contract.fund{value: 10 ether}();
uint256 version = contract.getVersion();
contract.withdraw();
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `msg.value`: The amount of Ether sent by the user when calling the `fund` function.
___
### Flow
1. The `fund` function is called by a user, and it checks if the value of `msg.value` converted to USD using the `getConversionRate` function is greater than or equal to the minimum value of USD.
2. If the condition is met, the user's address is added to the `addressToAmountFunded` mapping with the corresponding amount funded, and the address is added to the `funders` array.
3. The `getVersion` function returns the version of the Chainlink price feed contract.
4. The `withdraw` function is called by the contract owner, which sets the amount funded by each address to zero and clears the `funders` array. Then, the contract balance is transferred to the contract owner.
___
### Outputs
- `addressToAmountFunded`: A mapping that stores the amount funded by each address.
- `funders`: An array that stores the addresses of the funders.
- `version`: The version of the Chainlink price feed contract.
- Ether balance: The remaining balance of Ether in the contract after the withdrawal.
